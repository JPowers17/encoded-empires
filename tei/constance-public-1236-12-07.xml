        <p><persName><forename>Constance</forename>, by the grace of <name type="deity">god</name> <roleName>queen</roleName> of the <name type="ethnic">Bohemians</name>, to all the faithful of <name type="deity">Christ</name> to whom the present letters come, greetings in the <name type="deity">Lord</name></persName>.</p>
        <p>By the testimony of the presents, we profess that the church in <placeName>Werben (Vrbno)</placeName> received with full integrity a tithe from the town or the estate of the <orgName>Crusaders from the Teutonic house called Repin</orgName> by dower right from the time that we first came to <placeName>Bohemia</placeName>, with no one resisting, neither in our presence nor in the presence of our husband, the illustrious <persName><roleName>king</roleName> of <placeName>Bohemia</placeName></persName> of happy memory.</p>
        <p>Now truly, since the said church was bestowed on the <orgName>hospital of St. Francis</orgName>, which our illustrious daughter <persName><roleName>lady</roleName> <forename>Agnes</forename> established in <placeName>Prague</placeName></persName>, said <orgName>Crusaders of the Teutonic house</orgName> denied said tithe to said hospital against justice, which we say with pure conscience/knowledge.</p>
        <p>In witness of which thing we have conferred the present page fortified by the protection of our seal. Dated at <placeName>Tisnov</placeName>, 7th ides of December, in the year <date>1236-7</date>.</p>
