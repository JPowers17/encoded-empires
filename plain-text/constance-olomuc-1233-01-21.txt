Recipient: Nuns of St. Peter in Olomuc

In the name of the holy trinity. Let it be known to all who see this page in the present as well as the future, that I Constance, by the grace of God queen of Bohemia, with my son Premysl, by that same grace marquis of Moravia, for the good of our souls and those of our predecessors, confer the land belonging to the castrum of Novy Hradek in the town called Drozdovice on the devout/devoted virgins serving Christ at the church of St. Peter in Olomuc to possess by hereditary right peacefully in perpetuity. 

[We] grant freedom fully and absolutely to the poor residing on their farm in said town which they long ago conferred on the bishopric of Olomuc. We did this with the noble man Albert who then held the castrum of Novy Hradek, to whom the land belonged by reason of that castrum, he being present and offering benevolent consent and favor to our grant. 

And so that our charity may remain stable and certain, we had this charter confirmed by the reinforcement of our seals. Witnesses to this are: Woch chamberlain, Holach prefect of the city (purcravius), Preborn judge; Onex, Semizlas, Spitata, Slavata, Mztata, castellans of Olomuc, John deacon, Radozlaus archdeacon of Olomuc, Moyses archdeacon of Brezlav, Nicholas archdeacon of Brno, Alexius and Henry, canons of Olomuc. 

Enacted in Olomuc, 12th kalends of February, in the 1233rd year of the lord's incarnation.
