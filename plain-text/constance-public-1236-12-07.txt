Author: Constance of Hungary
Date: 1236, December 7
Recipient: Public

Constance, by the grace of god queen of the Bohemians, to all the faithful of Christ to whom the present letters come, greetings in the Lord. 

By the testimony of the presents, we profess that the church in Werben (Vrbno) received with full integrity a tithe from the town or the estate of the Crusaders from the Teutonic house called Repin by dower right from the time that we first came to Bohemia, with no one resisting, neither in our presence nor in the presence of our husband, the illustrious king of Bohemia of happy memory. 

Now truly, since the said church was bestowed on the hospital of St. Francis, which our illustrious daughter lady Agnes established in Prague, said Crusaders of the Teutonic house denied said tithe to said hospital against justice, which we say with pure conscience/knowledge. 

In witness of which thing we have conferred the present page fortified by the protection of our seal. Dated at Tisnov, 7th ides of December, in the year 1236-7.
